<p>I got a 59/67. I am pretty surprised that I got this score. Originally, I was very unconfident with many of the questions and I ended up doing poorly. This time however, I only got a few of them incorrect, meaning that my performance definitely increased. Here is a review of all the questions that I got incorrect and how I can avoid making them during the AP Test.</p>

<h2 id="QUESTION-60">QUESTION 60<a class="anchor-link" href="#QUESTION-60"> </a></h2><p>Consider two lists of numbers called list1 and list2. A programmer wants to determine how many different values appear in both lists. For example, if list1 contains [10, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60] and list2 contains [20, 20, 40, 60, 80], then there are three different values that appear in both lists (20, 40, and 60).</p>
<p>The programmer has the following procedures available.</p>
<p>Procedure Call  Explanation
Combine (myList1, myList2)  This procedure creates a new list containing the elements from ﻿myList1 ​followed by the entries from myList2. The resulting list is returned. For example, if myList1 contains [2, 4, 6] and myList2 contains [1, 5], the procedure will return the list [2, 4, 6, 1, 5].
RemoveAllDups (myList)  This procedure creates a new list containing the elements of myList with any duplicate values removed. The resulting list is returned. For example, if myList contains [3, 2, 4, 2, 2, 5, 6, 4], the procedure will return the list [3, 2, 4, 5, 6].
Which of the following can be used to assign the intended value to count ?</p>
<p>A
bothList 
←
 Combine (list1, list2)</p>
<p>uniqueList 
←
 RemoveAllDups (bothList)</p>
<p>count 
←
 LENGTH (bothList) - LENGTH (uniqueList)</p>
<p>B
newList1 
←
 RemoveAllDups (list1)</p>
<p>newList2 
←
 RemoveAllDups (list2)</p>
<p>bothList 
←
 Combine (newList1, newList2)</p>
<p>count 
←
 LENGTH (list1) + LENGTH (list2) - LENGTH (bothList)</p>
<p>C
newList1 
←
 RemoveAllDups (list1)</p>
<p>newList2 
←
 RemoveAllDups (list2)</p>
<p>bothList 
←
 Combine (newList1, newList2)</p>
<p>count 
←
 LENGTH (newList1) + LENGTH (newList2) - LENGTH (bothList)</p>
<p>D
newList1

<p>bothList 
←
 Combine (newList1, newList2)</p>
<p>uniqueList 
←
 RemoveAllDups (bothList)</p>
<p>count 
←
 LENGTH (bothList) - LENGTH (uniqueList)</p>
<p>Answer C
Incorrect. For example, assume that list1 contains [10, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60] and list2 contains [20, 20, 40, 60, 80]. The first line of code creates newList1, which contains [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]. The second line of code creates newList2, which contains [20, 40, 60, 80]. The third line of code creates bothList, which contains [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 20, 40, 60, 80]. The fourth line of code assigns to count the length of newList1 (6) plus the length of newList2 (4) minus the length of bothList (10), producing the incorrect result 0.</p>

<h2 id="QUESTION-34">QUESTION 34<a class="anchor-link" href="#QUESTION-34"> </a></h2><p>The following question uses a robot in a grid of squares. The robot is represented by a triangle, which is initially facing toward the top of the grid.</p>
<p>The figure presents a robot in a grid of squares with 5 rows and 7 columns. The robot is represented by a triangle, which is initially in the bottom row of the grid in the third square from the left, facing upwards, and ends in the top row of the grid, fifth square from the left, facing upwards. The fifth square from the left in the top row of the grid is shaded gray. A path of arrows shows the robot’s movement from its initial location to the gray square. The robot moves 1 square up, turns rightward, moves 2 squares to the right, turns upwards, and moves 3 squares upwards where it ends.
Consider the procedure below.</p>
<p>The figure presents a block of code that consists of 5 lines. Throughout the code there are nested blocks of code. [begin block] Line 1: PROCEDURE BotMover [begin block] x [end block] [Begin Block] Line 2: [begin block] MOVE_FORWARD [end block] Line 3: [begin block] REPEAT x Times [Begin Block] Line 4: [begin block] ROTATE_RIGHT [end block] [End Block] [end block] Line 5: [begin block] MOVE_FORWARD [end block] [End Block] [end block]
Which of the following code segments will move the robot to the gray square along the path indicated by the arrows?</p>
<p>A

<p>Answer D
Incorrect. In this code segment, the first call to BotMover moves the robot forward one square, rotates it right three times so that it faces left, and moves it forward one square. The second call to BotMover moves the robot forward one square, rotates it right 1 times so that it faces toward the top of the grid, then moves it forward one square. The third call to BotMover moves the robot forward one square, does not rotate it, then moves it forward one square to the upper left corner of the grid.</p>

<p>In a certain computer program, two positive integers are added together, resulting in an overflow error. Which of the following best explains why the error occurs?</p>
<p>A
The program attempted to perform an operation that is considered an undecidable problem.</p>
<p>B
The precision of the result is limited due to the constraints of using a floating-point representation.</p>
<p>C
The program can only use a fixed number of bits to represent integers; the computed sum is greater than the maximum representable value.</p>
<p>D
The program cannot represent integers; the integers are converted into decimal approximations, leading to rounding errors.</p>
<p>Answer D
Incorrect. While fractions are sometimes represented by decimal approximations that are subject to rounding errors, integers are not.</p>
