How the code works . The code uses the sqlite3 module to connect to a database file called database.db. It also defines a class called ArrivalTable which has methods for creating a table, inserting data into the table, and closing the connection to the database. Finally, the code creates an instance of the ArrivalTable class, prompts the user to input their information, and inserts it into the &quot;Arrivals&quot; table in the database. .",

It can modify image data by adjusting its visual characteristics such as size, color, and scale. Using Pandas allows the user to manipulate data. It can also alter data based on specific criteria. | . Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow) . PIL (Python Image Library) . Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? Converts binary encoded data into a coded text. Binary and Hexadecimal represent data in their original binary form and a human readable form. .

The Grey Scale algorithm takes an RGB pixel value, averages its red, green, and blue components, and sets all three components to the same average value to create a gray scale representation. | Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? Scale image resizes the image to a base width of 320 pixels while maintaining its aspect ratio, resulting in a smaller scaled image with the same aspect ratio as the original. Before scaling, the image is represented by a matrix of pixels, and after scaling, the image is still represented by a matrix of pixels but with a smaller resolution. | Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? Scale image can be considered a type of lossy compression as it reduces the resolution of the image, resulting in a loss of detail. This aligns with the College Board term &quot;data compression,&quot; which refers to techniques used to reduce the amount of data required to represent digital media while maintaining an acceptable level of quality. | . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(img): baseWidth = 320 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() # Set Properties of Image, Scale, and convert to Base64 def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(image[&#39;pil&#39;], image[&#39;format&#39;]) # Create Grey Scale Base64 representation of Image def image_management_add_html_grey(image): # Image open return PIL image object img = image[&#39;pil&#39;] format = image[&#39;format&#39;] img_data = img.getdata() # Reference https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pil-image-getdata/ image[&#39;data&#39;] = np.array(img_data) # PIL image to numpy array image[&#39;gray_data&#39;] = [] # key/value for data converted to gray scale # &#39;data&#39; is a list of RGB data, the list is traversed and hex and binary lists are calculated and formatted for pixel in image[&#39;data&#39;]: # create gray scale of image, ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-a-numpy-array-to-an-image/ average = (pixel[0] + pixel[1] + pixel[2]) // 3 # average pixel values and use // for integer division if len(pixel) &gt; 3: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average, pixel[3])) # PNG format else: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average)) # end for loop for pixels img.putdata(image[&#39;gray_data&#39;]) image[&#39;html_grey&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(img, format) # Jupyter Notebook Visualization of Images if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # Use numpy to concatenate two arrays images = image_data() # Display meta data, scaled view, and grey scale for each image for image in images: image_management(image) print(&quot;- meta data --&quot;) print(image[&#39;label&#39;]) print(image[&#39;source&#39;]) print(image[&#39;format&#39;]) print(image[&#39;mode&#39;]) print(&quot;Original size: &quot;, image[&#39;size&#39;]) print(&quot;Scaled size: &quot;, image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;]) print(&quot;-- original image --&quot;) display(HTML(image[&#39;html&#39;])) print(&quot; grey image -&quot;) image_management_add_html_grey(image) display(HTML(image[&#39;html_grey&#39;])) print() . - meta data -- Green Square Internet PNG RGBA Original size: (16, 16) Scaled size: (320, 320) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- Clouds Impression Peter Carolin PNG RGBA Original size: (320, 234) Scaled size: (320, 234) -- original image -- . grey image - .

I enjoyed socializing with my peers and seeing their hardwork come to life.I also liked explaining my groups project to people. I especially liked presenting my function. I saw many interesting projects made by other. Alongside seeing these projects, I was able to try them out and ask about the time and effort put into the work. The teachers were also present, offering constructive feedback and praising the hard work of the participants. The event gave me a chance to learn new skills and techniques from other participants, which I plan to incorporate into my future projects.Through N@TM I’ve come to a realization that you are able to see how much thought and creativity it takes to create a website that can be of use for the real world. I took pictures of a few of the pieces which were put onto display. . . Before exploring the photography classroom I was never really interested in photography but after seeing this picture of the beach I feel obligated to learn more. I like how the photo puts in you into someone elses shoes and shows you how they perceive the beach . . This website was really cool to play around with because it relates to fitness which is something I am very fond of. My friend helped create this website and I’ve heard him talk about it a lot so it was really nice to see what he’s been putting his time into. This website has many intreguing features such as a BMI calculator and a calorie management feature. . . I’ve seen a snake game before so seeing this wasn’t super interesting. I did like hearing about the process they took to make it and how each group member contributed. The scoring, controls, settings, and appearance were all such simple things to look at but the code for it was really advanced. . . This is Eli’s group project and it is for car rentals. I really liked their format of the website and I thought the idea of car rentals was unique and useful. The input with the api’s were all working effectively and I think its a good project possibly one of my favorites. .",

Beneficial Effect: Increased productivity and efficiency through automation of tasks and access to vast amounts of information. | Harmful Effect: Dependence on technology leading to loss of important job skills and a decrease in critical thinking. . | Beneficial Effect: Improved communication and connectivity through the use of social media and other online platforms. . | Harmful Effect: Increased spread of misinformation and potential for cyberbullying and online harassment. . | Beneficial Effect: Advancements in medical technology and research through the use of computing and data analysis. . | Harmful Effect: Privacy concerns and potential for discrimination based on genetic or health information stored in digital databases. | . Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? . Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the brain&#39;s reward and motivation system. Research has shown that imbalances in dopamine levels can contribute to a variety of mental health disorders, including ADHD, depression, and addiction. I think that it is important to know that these disorders are complex and are likely caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. When achieving something in school I feel less dopamine due to the fact that I am so used to the intake of dopamine from technology. . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? . Educate yourself about technology and the internet . | Build a positive online presence . | Learn new skills . | Take control of your personal data . | . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. .

Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? .

While loop: Code goes through elemetnts over and over again . Loops repeat something and its executed after its completed the repetition . Booleans- Recongnizes true/false . Iteration: Code goes through a segment . Pop: Takes away something at the end of the list . Increment/Decrement: Modifies the counter variable after each repetition . Array: Another name for a list . Initialization: What sets the counter variable to a starting value . Condition: Allows the computer to know whether or not to keep repeating the loop . Indexing: The position of an elemnt in a list starting from 0 . List Index: The position of an element in a list starting from 0 . Parameters: input values of a procedure . Arguments: specify values of the paramaters when the procedure is called . Append/Remove/Pop: Various methods, append adds an element to the end, remove removes at an index, and pop removes the last item . Elements: Item in a list . Modularity: An splitting large procedures into smaller ones with more uses . Binary: A basee two numbering system . Return: sends the output of the procedure to where it was called . Variable: data that is assigned to and held within a chosen name . Loop: a system where a segment of code is repeated until a requirement is met . Procedure: a named group of instructions that have paramaters and return values . Procedural Abstraction: name for a process that allow a procedure to be used by only knowing what it does . . Notes on lesson 5-7 . Nested conditional: . A conditional inside of a conditional | Often used in algorithms in order to print specific data or run certain tasks. | We can use conditionals inside conditionals to create further conditions in algorithms. | We can use flowcharts to help display an easy to understand diagram of what we want a code segment to do. | . Boolean: . Binary variable with only two possible values, &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; | . Relational Operators: . Multiple operators which are used to evaluate 2 variables. | In pseudocode the relational operators are =, &gt;, &lt;, ≠, ≥, and ≤. | Other languages use different formats to represent these operators. For example, Python uses != instead of ≠. | . | These operators help determine the boolean value of a statement. | . Logical Operators: . Allow for boolean values to be evaluated. | Pseudocode uses the logical operators NOT, AND, and OR. Javascript uses the same logic, but uses different ways to represent the operators: &amp;&amp;(and), | |(or), |(not). | . | . Algorithm: . Finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task | . Conditional Statements: . Conditional statements allow the code to act based on multiple conditions, such as user input or stored data. | We can use conditionals in algorithms in order to receive different outputs from a set of code, and help achieve the general purpose of the algorithm. | . Categories . Two broad types of conditional statements are if statements and if-else statements if statement: will go through certain statements if the if expression is true | if-else statement: will go through a statement no matter what, but the statement which is run depends on the if expression is true or false | . | . Flow Charts . We can use flowcharts to help organize the process of conditional statements. | .",

Create an algorithm that uses selection and/or iteration that will represent one player’s complete turn. . During a turn, each player gets 4 attempts/chances to get the greatest number possible. During each attempt, the player will use a random number generator to select a random number from 1 to 10. After they have had 4 chances, their score is the greatest number they received from the random number generator, and their turn is over. . import random numAttempts = [] i = 1 while i &lt;= 4: numAttempts.append(random.randint(1,10)) i = i +1 print(&quot;Attempts:&quot;, numAttempts) sort(randomNumber) print(&quot;Max Number:&quot;) print(max(numAttempts)) .

Explain why Binary Search is more efficient than Sequential Search . Binary search is more efficient because it moves exponentially while sequential search moves through the list one by one. Binary is able to search for half the numbers in a data set in one iteration, while sequential search has to go through every possibility. . . Problem 9 . [64,36,16,11,9] Explain which number you are finding, how many check it would take, and make a binary search tree . I am searching for the number 9, which would take 3 iterations. You would start at 16, the middle index. Then you would do 4+4/2 to get 4, so the next index would be 9. . .",

Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;tacos&quot;: 9.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 5.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 4.99} print (menu) order= input(&quot;Hi, What would you like to eat? &gt;&gt;&quot;) if order == &quot;tacos&quot;: print(&quot;you ordered tacos, your total is $5.99&quot;) elif order == &quot;fries&quot;: print(&quot;you ordered fries, your total is $9.99&quot;) elif order == &quot;drink&quot;: print(&quot;you ordered a drink, your total is $4.99&quot;) elif order != &quot;tacos&quot; or &quot;fries&quot; or &quot;drink&quot;: print(&quot;That item is not on the menu, try re-order&quot;) . {&#39;tacos&#39;: 9.99, &#39;fries&#39;: 5.99, &#39;drink&#39;: 4.99} you ordered tacos, your total is $5.99 . Hacks . What errors may arise in your project? . Some error that may arise in our project is dictionary errors, api errors, and syntax errors. When they input a letter it may not be read correctly and place the letter in the wrong spot or it may not say that a correct letter is included in a word. | . | What are some test cases that can be used? . We can test inputting some correct letters and some wrong letters. This will lead to our desired output. If we type in a wrong letter a body part will appear. | . | Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem. . I will document any errors I have and inform my team. | . | What are “single” tests that you will perform on your project? Or, your part of the project? . I will first play the game for myself and then I will ask peers to review the game aswell. | . | .",

You can control the snake with 4 buttons. You can use the up arrow, down arrow, left arrow, and right arrow as inputs.If the snake hits a border the player ultimately loses the game. The twist to the game is that there is no limit for how large you can get. You will keep growing until you hit yourself or one of the borders. The snake game fits the criteria because it has functioning inputs and outputs. The game has a loop which is what happens when you lose. You are able to go back to the start of the game. When you lose the game your highscore is kept on a dictionary which shows you your most recent and your highest score. Snake also has the prodcedural abstraction which is what happens when you click the start. The game also features sequencing when you lose the game it lets you restart. Input and output is part of the testing too. Startimg the game and restarting. Also moving the snake with the buttons. The purpose of the game is to cure boredom and make the world a better place. .",

            "content": "Hello, inorder to do the python quiz you must understand a few components. What is python? Python is a high-level and general-purpose language that focuses on code readability. It’s one of the most popular beginner languages because of its ease of use, wide application, active community, and freedom of use. Programmers can use it for object-oriented, structured, or functional tasks. Python has a comprehensive standard library, which has earned the language the title “batteries included.” The libraries provide tools for many tasks, such as creating internet applications, graphical user interfaces, and data analytics. . The ease of use of this language is because of its simple, less-cluttered syntax and grammar with freedom of methodology during programming. Unlike most languages, python uses English words instead of punctuation. It also has fewer exceptional cases and syntactic exceptions than C language. Employers can use it in information technology, engineering, professional services, and design. Python helps you work fast to integrate systems as a glue language. It’s also a popular rapid application development (RAD) language. .",

            "content": "Crowd Sourcing Hacks . Think of a use case for crowdsourcing in you project … . CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. . A use for crowdsourcing in a computer science project could be to gather data on user preferences and opinions. For example, you could provide a survey among th students in the class to gather data on what topics they find most interesting. This data could then be used to create future lessons and assignments to better meet the needs and interests of the students. | As for Del Norte crowdsourcing, it depends on the project. If the project involves collecting data from a large group of people, such as community feedback on a proposed development project, then crowdsourcing could definitely be beneficial. | For N@tM (Night at the Museum), you could use crowdsourcing to gather data on the most popular exhibits, activities, and events. This data could then be used to create a more engaging and personalized experience for visitors in the future. During finals week, you could present this data to teachers as evidence of the impact of your work, demonstrating the value and impact of N@tM on the community. | . Computing Bias Hacks . Write summary/thoughts/conclusions from each of the exercises above. Focus on avoiding Bias in algorithms or code you write. . Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? . TikTok is more popular among younger generations, particularly teens and young adults. There is no purposeful exclusion in these platforms but the design and content that each platform offers caters to different age groups. | Whether this is harmful or not depends on personal perspective. I think that it could lead to age-based digital divide. | . Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? . I think that virtual asistants have female voices because they are more aimed towards the male audience. People tend to prefer female voices for communication and find them more trustworthy aswell. I don&#39;t think its harmful because many companies feature male and female voices. It is good business because it allows a varitery of options. | . Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google) . Recommendation algorithim | For example, Amazon&#39;s recommendation algorithm suggests products based on the user&#39;s previous purchases, searches, and browsing history. | . Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas… . Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? Yes. | If yes or no, justify you conclusion. | . He calls the computer racist. . How do you think this happened? | . Not enough testing done, bad lighting, and maybe some racism (not sure). . Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? | . It can be harmful for people of color because they may have spent a lot of money on the computer so they could use the feature. I&#39;m not fully sure if it was an accident or not. I don&#39;t think they meant to exclude people of color. . Should it be corrected? | . Yes definetly. . What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? | . Maybe make a program which is able to pick up peoples faces, skin color, hair, and other physical features better inorder to make the computure more inclusive. .",
