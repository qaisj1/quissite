<h2 id="Talk-about-dopamine-issues-above.-Real?-Parent-conspiracy?-Anything-that-is-impacting-your-personal-study-and-success-in-High-School?">Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?<a class="anchor-link" href="#Talk-about-dopamine-issues-above.-Real?-Parent-conspiracy?-Anything-that-is-impacting-your-personal-study-and-success-in-High-School?"> </a></h2><p>Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the brain's reward and motivation system. Research has shown that imbalances in dopamine levels can contribute to a variety of mental health disorders, including ADHD, depression, and addiction. I think that it is important to know that these disorders are complex and are likely caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. When achieving something in school I feel less dopamine due to the fact that I am so used to the intake of dopamine from technology.</p>

<li>An empowered individual can help someone who is not empowered by sharing their knowledge, skills, and resources by mentoring a student, creating a peer support group, volunteering in the classroom like Theo, and by sharing your experiences with people who faced or are facing the same problems as you.</li>

<li>I don't really understand this question but I definetly think there are some rules which limit people from gaining digital power. Some of the barriers at Del Norte, I think involve limited access to training, support, and website (blocked by the school)</li>
