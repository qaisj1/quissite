<p>Notes:
Diver perspectives eliminate bias in development, Computing innovations include a program as a part of its function. Computing innovations are improved through collaberation. Github is used to work with your team. Commenting in code helps your teammates. Think-pair-share is a process where students think though a process alone. Computing innovation can be physical or non physical.</p>
<p>Hacks: Me and my partner are Afghan. We both enjoy computer science. He knows more about computer science than me. We both like going to the gym.</p>
