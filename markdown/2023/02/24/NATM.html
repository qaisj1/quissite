<p>My experience at Night at the Musuem was really fun. I enjoyed socializing with my peers and seeing their hardwork come to life.I also liked explaining my groups project to people. I especially liked presenting my function. I saw many interesting projects made by other. Alongside seeing these projects, I was able to try them out and ask about the time and effort put into the work. The teachers were also present, offering constructive feedback and praising the hard work of the participants. The event gave me a chance to learn new skills and techniques from other participants, which I plan to incorporate into my future projects.Through N@TM I’ve come to a realization that you are able to see how much thought and creativity it takes to create a website that can be of use for the real world. I took pictures of a few of the pieces which were put onto display.</p>
