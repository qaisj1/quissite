What is python? Python is a high-level and general-purpose language that focuses on code readability. It’s one of the most popular beginner languages because of its ease of use, wide application, active community, and freedom of use. Programmers can use it for object-oriented, structured, or functional tasks. Python has a comprehensive standard library, which has earned the language the title “batteries included.” The libraries provide tools for many tasks, such as creating internet applications, graphical user interfaces, and data analytics.</p>

<p>The ease of use of this language is because of its simple, less-cluttered syntax and grammar with freedom of methodology during programming. Unlike most languages, python uses English words instead of punctuation. It also has fewer exceptional cases and syntactic exceptions than C language. Employers can use it in information technology, engineering, professional services, and design. Python helps you work fast to integrate systems as a glue language. It’s also a popular rapid application development (RAD) language.</p>
