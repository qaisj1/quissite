<p>I made a note of gratitude to my mom and to my friend. I told my friend how much I appreciated him. He said thank you but there was nothing else beyond that. I told my mom that I am very thankful for her and for everything that she does for me. She said that she is glad that I understand what she does for me and my brother.
