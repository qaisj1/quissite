    "\n",
    "Nested conditional: \n",
    "- A conditional inside of a conditional\n",
    "- Often used in algorithms in order to print specific data or run certain tasks.\n",
    "- We can use conditionals inside conditionals to create further conditions in algorithms.\n",
    "- We can use flowcharts to help display an easy to understand diagram of what we want a code segment to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean: \n",
    "- Binary variable with only two possible values, \"true\" or \"false\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational Operators:\n",
    "- Multiple operators which are used to evaluate 2 variables. \n",
    "- In pseudocode the relational operators are =, >, <, ≠, ≥, and ≤. \n",
    "- Other languages use different formats to represent these operators. \n",
    "    - For example, Python uses != instead of ≠. \n",
    "- These operators help determine the boolean value of a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical Operators: \n",
    "- Allow for boolean values to be evaluated. \n",
    "- Pseudocode uses the logical operators NOT, AND, and OR. \n",
    "    - Javascript uses the same logic, but uses different ways to represent the operators: &&(and), | |(or), |(not).\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm: \n",
    "- Finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional Statements: \n",
    "- Conditional statements allow the code to act based on multiple conditions, such as user input or stored data.\n",
    "- We can use conditionals in algorithms in order to receive different outputs from a set of code, and help achieve the general purpose of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categories\n",
    "- Two broad types of conditional statements are if statements and if-else statements\n",
    "    - if statement: will go through certain statements if the if expression is true\n",
    "    - if-else statement: will go through a statement no matter what, but the statement which is run depends on the if expression is true or false\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow Charts\n",
    "- We can use flowcharts to help organize the process of conditional statements. \n",
