Problem 40: Answer A is correct and answer C is incorrect. The value 8 would be the output if the statement DISPLAY(x + y) were executed. Problem 41: Answer B is correct and answer A is incorrect. This is the initial value of p. None of the variables has the value 10 after executing the code segment. Problem 42: Answer C answer is correct and answer D is incorrect. After initially assigning values to the variables, the code segment assigns the value 4 to num3 and assigns the value 8 to num1. The value of sum at the end of the code segment is 8 + 4 + 4, or 16. Problem 43: Answer C is correct and answer B is incorrect. This would be the value of result if the loop iterated one less time. Problem 44: Answer C is correct and answer A is inccorect. For any integer n, the value of n MOD 1 is always 0. Problem 47: Answer D is correct and answer C is incorrect. The eighth statement assigns the value of c + d / 2 (which is 50) to d. Problem 50: Answer A is correct and answer B is incorrect. This statement takes the first two characters of firstName and concatenates them with the first two characters of lastName, assigning a string that is four characters long to initials." />
